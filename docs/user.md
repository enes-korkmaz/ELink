# Introduction

This is the project-related user documentation for the expert and project management web application “∃Link”. This platform was developed with the aim of making the internal workflow of stakeholders more efficient and effective.The following sections explain the navigation and functions of the application, among other things.  

---
---

# General Information

## User roles 

- **Employee** has advanced rights to - e.g.manage projects, invite Experts, add Experts to projects and if neccessary to assisting in editing their profiles.

- **Intern** has restricted access, allowing only to view specific content - project pages & expert profiles.  

- **Expert** gets invited, to register, setup and maintain a profile - including their expertise, skills, etc..   

## User Guides Overview

### Notifications 

Troughout the application the users will be guided by notifications that inform them about the status of their interactions.

- **Valid**: E.g. when succesfully login in the user will be greeted, by an green boxed text notification scentered on their upper screen (under navbar). It will fade away after a sensible time.
- **Invalid**: E.g. when entering wrong credentials during login, a red boxed text notification will apear on screen and fade away eventually.

### Pop-Ups

These messages will require user interaction, mainly these are utilized to ensure an user does not unintentionally apply or lose changes.

A message could say: "Are you sure you want to cancel creating this profile? All unsaved changes will be lost." 

And allow an action to be either **continued** by clicking the button "Ok" or **cancelled** by clicking "Cancel". 

### Context-sensitive help

To guide new experts and employees our forms and tools, have inline instructions and tooltips:

- **Inline instructions** - appear as advice when information is entered incorrectly. E.g. the border of an input field as well as the header will be colored red and explaining text will apear under.
- **Tooltips and Popovers** - these appear when an `info icon` is clicked to provide more context to the refering element. E.g. "To add a new skill, enter the term in the text field and click the '+' button (or 'Add'). [...]"

### Breadcrums

This supports wayfinding — making users aware of their current location within the application. It is located in the navbar, e.g. "∃Link > Projects > Create project".

## Automatic session termination

After 30 minutes of inactivity, the session will be terminated. The user will need to authenticate (login) again to gain access.

Access it via navigation bar, [see here](/docs/user#structure--contents).

## Category Section

### Add New Category
- Type the term in the `Add a term` field.
- Click the **Add button** (or '+'). 

Note: The new category will appear at the beginning of the list.

**Requirements:**
  - Between 2–30 characters
  - Alphanumeric (letters, numbers, spaces)

### Update Existing Category
  - Click on the term in the list or its **Pen and Paper Icon**.

Extra skills are optional tags that experts can assign to their profiles.

### Extra Skill to Category

  - Select the skill by `checking its box`. 
  - Click the **Add button** (or '+'). 
  
  Note: Skills that are already assigned to a category will no longer appear in the extra skill list.  Skills are sorted by frequency of occurrence and alphabetically.

**When to convert a skill as a category?**
Experts may list their extra skills voluntarily.
If a skill appears frequently, it’s a good candidate to become a selectable category for others.

Tip: Skills are listed with a count of how often they occur in all expert profiles.
